## Notes

Because of the use of GraphLab, these Jupyter notebooks depend on Python 2.

Here are the instructions on how to set up GraphLab [https://turi.com/download/install-graphlab-create-command-line.html](https://turi.com/download/install-graphlab-create-command-line.html)

I have used anaconda to manage multiple versions of Python.

Once you have installed anaconda you need to set up an environment - see [Managing environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

To switch to your new Python enviroment you need to do
```
source activate gl-env
```

Then you can run `jupyter-notebook`.
